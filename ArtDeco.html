  <p>
    Art Deco, also called style modern, movement in the decorative arts and architecture that originated in the 1920s and developed into a major style in western Europe and the United States during the 1930s. Its name was derived from the Exposition International des Arts Decoratifs et Industrials Moderns, held in Paris in 1925, where the style was first exhibited. Art Deco design represented modernism turned into fashion. Its products included both individually crafted luxury items and mass-produced wares, but, in either case, the intention was to create a sleek and antitraditional elegance that symbolized wealth and sophistication.
  </p>
  <p>
  The distinguishing features of the style are simple, clean shapes, often with a “streamlined” look; ornament that is geometric or stylized from representational forms; and unusually varied, often expensive materials, which frequently include man-made substances (plastics, especially Bakelite; vita-glass; and ferroconcrete) in addition to natural ones (jade, silver, ivory, obsidian, chrome, and rock crystal). Though Art Deco objects were rarely mass-produced, the characteristic features of the style reflected admiration for the modernity of the machine and for the inherent design qualities of machine-made objects (e.g., relative simplicity, planarity, symmetry, and unvaried repetition of elements).
</p>
<p>
Among the formative influences on Art Deco were Art Nouveau, the Bauhaus, Cubism, and Serge Diaghilev’s Ballets Russes. Decorative ideas came from American Indian, Egyptian, and early classical sources as well as from nature. Characteristic motifs included nude female figures, animals, foliage, and sun rays, all in conventionalized forms.
</p>
<p>
Art Deco was a pastiche of many different styles, sometimes contradictory, united by a desire to be modern. From its outset, Art Deco was influenced by the bold geometric forms of Cubism; the bright colors of Fauvism and of the Ballets Russes; the updated craftsmanship of the furniture of the eras of Louis Philippe I and Louis XVI; and the exotic styles of China and Japan, India, Persia, ancient Egypt and Maya art. It featured rare and expensive materials, such as ebony and ivory, and exquisite craftsmanship. The Chrysler Building and other skyscrapers of New York built during the 1920s and 1930s are monuments of the Art Deco style. (Flanagan, 2019)

<h3 id="features">MAIN FEATURES AND CHARACTERISTICS</h3>
<ul>
  <li>It combined modern styles with fine craftsmanship and rich materials. During its heyday, Art Deco represented luxury, glamour, exuberance, and faith in social and technological progress.</li>
  <li>Art Deco is one of the first truly international styles, but its dominance ended with the beginning of World War II and the rise of the strictly functional and unadorned styles of modern architecture and the International Style of architecture that followed.</li>
  <li>The emergence of Art Deco was closely connected with the rise in status of decorative artists, who until late in the 19th century had been considered simply as artisans.</li>
  <li>Art Deco was associated with both luxury and modernity; it combined very expensive materials and exquisite craftsmanship put into modernistic forms. Nothing was cheap about Art Deco: pieces of furniture included ivory and silver inlays, and pieces of Art Deco jewelry combined diamonds with platinum, jade, and other precious materials. The style was used to decorate the first-class salons of ocean liners, deluxe trains, and skyscrapers. It was used around the world to decorate the great movie palaces of the late 1920s and 1930s. Later, after the Great Depression, the style changed and became more sober. (Flanagan, 2019)</li>
  <li>Sculpture was a very common and integral feature of Art Deco architecture. In France, allegorical bas-reliefs representing dance and music by Antoine Bourdelle decorated the earliest Art Deco landmark in Paris, the Théâtre des Champs-Élysées in Paris, in 1912. The 1925 had major sculptural works placed around the site, pavilions were decorated with sculptural friezes, and several pavilions devoted to smaller studio sculpture. In the 1930s, a large group of prominent sculptors made works for the 1937 Exposition Internationale des Arts et Techniques dans la Vie Moderne at Chaillot. Alfred Janniot made the relief sculptures on the facade of the Palais de Tokyo.</li>
  <li>Public art deco sculpture was almost always representational, usually of heroic or allegorical figures related to the purpose of the building or room. The themes were usually selected by the patrons, not the artist. Abstract sculpture for decoration was extremely rare. (Flanagan, 2019)</li>
  <li>The Art Deco style appeared early in the graphic arts, in the years just before World War I. It appeared in Paris in the posters and the costume designs of Leon Bakst for the Ballets Russes, and in the catalogs of the fashion designers Paul Poire.</li>
  <li>During the Art Nouveau period, posters usually advertised theatrical products or cabarets. In the 1920s, travel posters, made for steamship lines and airlines, became extremely popular. The style changed notably in the 1920s, to focus attention on the product being advertised. The images became simpler, precise, more linear, more dynamic, and were often placed against a single-color background. (Flanagan, 2019)</li>

<h3 id="architecture">ARCHITECTURE</h3>
<p>
Art Deco architecture is very striking and looks different from earlier styles. You'll definitely notice it when you see it. Builders used new industrial materials like stucco, concrete and stainless steel. You can also find structures decorated with aluminum, chrome, opaque plate glass, and glass block.
</p>
<p>
Popular design elements in Art Deco included geometric shapes like the pyramid; the chevron, an inverted V shape connected to form zigzag lines; and lightning bolts. Art Deco also sometimes used stylized images from nature like waterfalls, sunrises, and palm tree leaves. You can see arched sunrise-like figures on the top of the Chrysler Building. There are several themes that occur regularly in Art Deco design. They include:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>Leaves, branches, and feathers.</li>
  <li>Nudes.</li>
  <li>Trapezoids.</li>
  <li>Stylized animals.</li>
  <li>Chevrons and zigzags.</li>
  <li>Sunbursts.</li>
  <li>Jagged, pointed edges inspired by skyscrapers (such as the Chrysler building).</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="interior">INTERIORS AND FURNITURE</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Geometric and angular forms, exotic materials, and linear decoration characterize Art Deco design. The look is strong and bold with no fussiness or romance anywhere in sight.</li>
  <li>Certain materials pop up again and again in art deco interior design: stainless steel, mirrors, chrome, glass, lacquer, inlaid wood, and even exotic skins like shark and zebra. Expensive materials such as ebony, marble, and rare woods were also often used, making some Art Deco pieces accessible only to the wealthy. (Flanagan, 2019)</li>
