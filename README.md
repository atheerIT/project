Web Programming with Python and JavaScript

Introduction:
In this project, I designed a website that has been built as introduction to four of historical interior design movement. The process that I follow to do this website is following the two research steps which is primary and secondary research. The primary research had been done by travelling to the V&A Museum and other places by using online virtual tour. The secondary research is conducted by doing online research about selected movements and finding examples for each era.

Design Tools and Technics:
-	HTML: used to design the website content the files are (index.html, ArtDeco.html, ArtNouveau.html, Baroque.html, reference.html, Renaissance.html). 
-	CSS: used to style the HTML content, the files are (index.css, pages.css). 
-	SASS: have been used to generate the CSS files in all the project, the files are (index.scss, pages.scss). 
-       the rest of files is just images and supported files for the website.
