  <h3>Introduction</h3>
  <p>
    The process that I follow to do this task is following the two research steps which is primary and secondary research. The primary research had been done by travelling to the V&A Museum and other places by using online virtual tour. I found out this stage helped me by collecting the information personally. Therefore, it relates directly to the movements that had been chosen. Moreover, I was full control of how and from where the data can be collected. The disadvantages of primary are that is expensive to collect and take a long time to process. The second phase is conducted by doing online research about selected movements and finding examples for each era. In my opinion, the advantages of this stage are the ease to access a rich mount of information with variety of examples. Besides, the information can be very cheap and free to access. However, the data may be outdated, inaccurate and not relevant to the original context. Therefore, the research overall increases my ability to find information about specific movement. And, it helped me to imagine the development of design movement among ages.
